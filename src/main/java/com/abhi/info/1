formatter can also worki as a editor

we can use converter as well it is latest now
it is not recommedned to use cookies
 we should use session over cookies
 session belongs to server has a id
 and that id sent as a cookie
 if you have millions of users we can't store
 session cokkies values in as server which is not feasuble
 we can't store session related data forever we need some time to
 one way we can do this by session timeout in sessionconfig tag in web.xml file
  like this<session-config>
 <session-timeout>30</session-timeout>
 </session-config>

 or we can do in handler methods also


 if cookies are blocked we can do tell user to on the cookies
 or we can send the session id in the url
 witht tht ehelp of <c:url> in jsp pages
 /sendemail;jsessionid=234242342342234dsffds32


we can use modelAttribute over the method in controller methods
so in a controller first it @modelattribute annotations methods
those thing returns by the methods will be passed to the model
in the handler methods models and
